# Code-Lou-Portfolio-Project

Thank you for looking at my first ever website, a portfolio page for me!  I have learned so much in this process (and learned where I can improve!) and I am excited to share this with you at this time.  The features included in this project include :

CSS -

A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a desktop.

Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table 

JAVASCRIPT - 

Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code. 

Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow. --THIS PART IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I AM WORKING TO GET THIS PART TO WORK AS INTENDED!
